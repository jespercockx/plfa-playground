# Agda Playground

A template for building an interactive, type-checkable Agda website that runs
entirely in the browser. Drop `.agda` or `.lagda.md` files into `content/`, and
GitHub Pages serves an editor plus the Agda Language Server compiled to
WebAssembly — code never leaves the visitor's machine.

This repository is the canonical starter. For a worked example with a full book
of content, see
[`jespercockx/plfa-playground`](https://github.com/jespercockx/plfa-playground).

## What works

- Agda type checking, compiler highlighting, goals, errors, and warnings
- Language-server hover types plus buffer- and import-aware name completion
- Agda/Emacs-style Unicode composition (`\to` → `→`, `\all` → `∀`, …)
- Give, Refine, and case-split interactions that edit and re-check the source
- Top-level type inference and normalization
- The bundled Agda standard library
- Browser-local autosave and persistent source/interface caches (IndexedDB)
- Responsive layout and a resizable goal inspector

## Quickstart

1. Use this template (or clone it) into a new repository.
2. Add your sources to `content/`. The starter ships with none, so the editor
   opens an empty `Main.agda`.
3. Run it locally:

   ```sh
   npm ci
   npm run dev
   ```

   The first run downloads the pinned Agda runtime (see
   [Runtime and distribution](#runtime-and-distribution)) and caches it under
   `.runtime-cache/`. Open <http://localhost:5173> and press Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to
   check the module.

4. Enable GitHub Pages: **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**, and
   **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions = Read and write**.
   Every push to `master` that passes CI is deployed to
   `https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/`.

## Content

Sources live in `content/` and are described by `playground.config.json`.

- `.agda` files are shown as a single code block; `.lagda.md` files are rendered
  as Markdown with their ` ```agda ` blocks editable and checkable.
- A Markdown file may start with frontmatter whose `title:` sets its display
  name:

  ```markdown
  ---
  title: Natural numbers
  ---
  ```

- Files in the content root belong to no group; files in a subdirectory form a
  group named after that directory. For example `content/part1/Foo.agda` is in
  group `part1`; a root with only top-level files renders without any group
  headers.
- Groups are ordered by the key order of `groups` in `playground.config.json`,
  then any extra groups alphabetically. Within a group, chapters follow the
  `order` list, then alphabetically.

```sh
npm run sync:content
```

regenerates the display sources, the Agda project archive, and the content index
under `static/content/`. `npm run dev` and `npm run build` run it automatically.

### Module names

Agda derives a module's name from its path relative to the library root, so the
path inside the project archive has to match the `module … where` header you
write. `modulePrefix` sets the directory the content is placed under:

- The starter sets `"modulePrefix": ""`, so `content/Main.agda` declares
  `module Main where`.
- A project with modules named `mylib.Widget` would set `"modulePrefix": "mylib"`
  and place the file at `content/Widget.agda`.

When `modulePrefix` is omitted it defaults to `library`.

### Configuration reference

`playground.config.json` keys:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Site title shown in the UI |
| `library` | Agda library name; names the generated `<library>.agda-lib` and is the default `modulePrefix` |
| `modulePrefix` | Directory content modules are placed under (`""` for the root) |
| `source` | Upstream source URL, linked in the footer |
| `license`, `licenseFile` | License label and the file to copy into `static/content/` for display |
| `groups` | Display titles for content directories |
| `order` | Explicit chapter order per group |
| `playgroundSource` | Initial text of the built-in editor document; `""` opens a blank `Main.agda` |
| `dependencies` | Agda library dependencies of the generated project (default `["standard-library"]`) |
| `runtime` | Which `agda-als-dist` release(s) to download (see below) |
| `interfaces` | Standard-library interface mode (see below) |
| `importRewrite` | Optional import-rewrite map (see below) |

### Optional: import rewriting

If your sources import broad standard-library modules, you can rewrite those
imports onto narrow adapter modules for faster checking. Each adapter is an
ordinary checked Agda module; the displayed source stays the original text.
Because Agda reports positions against the displayed text, every replacement
module name must be **exactly the same UTF-8 width** as the name it replaces, so
that ranges, highlighting, errors, goals, and editor scroll synchronization stay
aligned.

This is off by default (identity). The worked example
([`plfa-playground`](https://github.com/jespercockx/plfa-playground)) shows a full
`importRewrite` spec: a `modules` map of adapter sources, an `imports` map of
`[from, to]` pairs, optional `conditionalImports`, and `stripSections`.

## Runtime and distribution

The Agda compiler and language server are a 33 MB WASI executable (about 10 MB
over the wire as gzip). It is **not** committed to this repository. Instead,
`runtime` in `playground.config.json` pins one or more releases of
[`jespercockx/agda-als-dist`](https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-als-dist), and
`scripts/sync-runtime.mjs` downloads them:

```json
"runtime": {
  "repository": "jespercockx/agda-als-dist",
  "releases": ["v2.8.0-als-e6541f8"]
}
```

Before `npm run dev` and `npm run build`, the script fetches each release's
`dist-manifest.json`, checks every artifact against the byte length and SHA-256
it records, and copies them into `static/`. Downloads are cached under
`.runtime-cache/` (gitignored), so later builds are offline; CI caches the same
directory.

Add `"manifestSha256": "<hash>"` (per release, or at the top level for a single
release) to authenticate the tag itself by pinning the manifest bytes. It is
optional: without it the manifest is fetched on every run and only the artifact
hashes inside it are trusted.

To bump the runtime, change the tag in `runtime.releases` (and update
`manifestSha256` if you use it). Only **Agda 2.8.0 and later** are supported:
earlier releases predate the `--setup` primitive installer and the
`_build/<version>/agda/` interface layout the runtime relies on. See the dist
repo's [`UPDATING.md`](https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-als-dist/blob/main/UPDATING.md)
for how a release is produced.

For an air-gapped mirror or local testing, `PLAYGROUND_RUNTIME_BASE_URL`
overrides the GitHub download base, with the release tag appended.

## Standard-library interfaces

Agda recompiles a standard-library module from source unless it finds a
precompiled interface (`.agdai`) for it, and a broad import such as
`import Data.Nat` pulls in a large part of the library — minutes on the first
check. The `interfaces` setting fetches those files on demand instead: Agda
decides which interface it wants, and only the ones a check needs are fetched,
one request per file.

- `{ "mode": "same-origin" }` — what this starter ships. `sync:runtime`
  downloads the release's interface archive at build time and extracts it into
  `static/stdlib-interfaces/<agdaVersion>/`; the site serves it and therefore
  carries the whole tree (about 190 MB of files). Reloads reuse the interfaces
  from IndexedDB and make no further requests.
- `{ "mode": "none" }` — never fetch; compile everything from source. Omitted
  `interfaces` behaves like this.
- `{ "mode": "cross-origin", "baseUrl": "https://…" }` — fetch each interface
  from `baseUrl` at runtime. `baseUrl` must be a **CORS host** serving the tree
  as `<baseUrl>/src/<Module>.agdai`. A GitHub release asset will not work:
  release downloads carry no `access-control-allow-origin`, so a cross-origin
  isolated page cannot fetch them. Pages, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, and
  jsDelivr do set the header.

Interfaces are version-specific: the tree must be built by the same Agda version
the site ships. A missing or mismatched file is ignored and Agda compiles that
module normally, so a partial or stale tree costs time, never correctness.

### Optional: precompiling site content

The same idea applies to *your* content and the standard library it imports. With
a native Agda of the matching version on `PATH`, the optional fast path
precompiles per-chapter archives so the first visit does not type-check the
standard library and every earlier chapter:

```sh
npm run precompile:content -- /path/to/agda-2.8.0
```

It refreshes the deduplicated archives under `static/content/interfaces/` and the
dependency index. Skip it if you do not ship a native Agda of the pinned version,
or if you prefer to keep your repository free of precompiled data; everything
still works, just with a slower first check.

## Build and verify

```sh
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
```

The static site is written to `build/`. The deploy workflow
(`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) builds with `BASE_PATH=/<repository>` and
publishes to GitHub Pages after CI passes.

With a local Chromium/Chrome available, the browser regression benchmark checks
the content in a real browser:

```sh
npm run dev   # in another terminal
PLAYGROUND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173 npm run benchmark:content
```

Set `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` if Chrome is not on `PATH`; `CHAPTERS=A,B` narrows a run
to named chapters.

## Architecture

```text
  ┌──────────────┐  LSP over a transport   ┌──────────────────┐
  │  main thread │ ───────────────────────▶ │  ALS worker      │
  │  CodeMirror  │                          │  Agda (WASI)     │
  │  LSP client  │ ◀─────────────────────── │  stdio over SPSC │
  └──────┬───────┘                          └────────┬─────────┘
         │  drive requests (JSON)                     │  file syscalls
         ▼                                            ▼
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  drive worker — in-memory filesystem, stdlib, content,     │
  │  IndexedDB cache, on-demand .agdai fetch (interfaces)      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The main thread hosts CodeMirror and an LSP client. A dedicated worker runs the
Agda Language Server under WASI, and a second worker owns its in-memory
filesystem together with the bundled standard library and your content. Shared
single-producer/single-consumer (SPSC) buffers connect the workers without a
remote backend; file contents cross that bridge as binary data rather than
JSON/Base64.

The compiler is unmodified, stock Agda. Checks reuse Agda's own interfaces and
one long-lived interaction process.

## Limitations

- **First-load download.** The first visit downloads the ~10 MB gzip wasm and the
  primitive data archive; the browser caches them afterwards.
- **First-visit reload.** The app needs `SharedArrayBuffer`, so the page must be
  cross-origin isolated with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
  `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. GitHub Pages cannot set response
  headers, so the bundled `static/coi-serviceworker.js` supplies them, at the
  cost of one automatic reload on the first visit.
- **Per-site build size.** With `interfaces.mode: "same-origin"` (the default)
  every deployment carries the full ~190 MB interface tree, even if no visitor
  imports the standard library. `cross-origin` (host nothing) and `none` (fetch
  nothing) are the alternatives.
- **Vite cap.** `vite` is held below 8.3 on purpose; see the comment in
  `package.json`. Bumping it silently breaks the WASM worker.

## Hosting elsewhere

The build is a plain static site (`build/`), so any static host works. The only
requirement is that pages are cross-origin isolated, either by sending the two
COOP/COEP headers or by relying on the bundled `coi-serviceworker.js`. To deploy
under a subpath, build with `BASE_PATH=/<subpath>`; all runtime URLs are
base-aware.
